Patients will be randomized to either Zygel or placebo. The ABCC FXS Social Avoidance subscale is the same primary endpoint used in the CONNECTFX trial. Topline results for the RECONNECT trial are expected in the first half of . We believe Zygel may provide an effective treatment for patients with FXS that have a completely methylated FMR gene based on its capacity to interact with the endocannabinoid system which is compromised in patients with FXS. FABC In September we reported the results for our openlabel exploratory Phase clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zygel in children with FXS which we refer to as the FABC Treatment of F ragile X Syndrome A nxiety and B ehavioral Challenges with C BD trial. Zygel was shown to be generally well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with data from earlier clinical trials and our other Phase clinical trials for Zygel. The completely methylated patients participating in CONNECTFX consisted of of in the intent to treat population with one patient excluded from the efficacy analysis due to lack of a postbaseline efficacy measure. During infancy doctors address the acute physical concerns such as anomalies of heart and palate with surgery. Early control of anxiety may delay the development of such psychoses. Cannabidiol may treat the neuropsychiatric symptoms of q due to its activity as an agonist at HT A receptors an antagonist at GPR receptors and a modulator of the endocannabinoid system. Patients receiving Zygel achieved statistically significant caregiverreported improvements compared to baseline across all subscales of the AIM Atypical behavior p . We have sought and intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for our product candidates as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and selected other countries. The steps required to obtain approval for commercialization of a new drug in the United States are lengthy complex and expensive and the outcome is far from certain. Certain types of animal studies must be conducted in compliance with the FDAs GLP regulations and the Animal Welfare Act which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. If the application is not sufficiently complete the FDA may refuse to accept the NDA for filing and request additional information. Additionally before approving an NDA the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Unlike an ANDA a b may be submitted for a product that differs in active ingredient strength route of administration dosage form or other conditions of use. By contrast NCE exclusivity prevents the FDA from accepting for review an application for a followon product that contains the protected active moiety during the fiveyear period dating from the products approval. In the future if our product candidates receive FDA approval we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. Data Exclusivity In the European Union if a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities and a further two years of market exclusivity during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. Product candidates that qualify for orphan drug designation may also qualify for other FDA programs that are intended to expedite the development and approval process and as a practical matter clinical trials for orphan product candidates may be smaller simply because of the smaller patient population. Additionally the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing investigational new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs involving serious or lifethreatening diseases or conditions.',\n"," 'Item Business General United Security Bancshares is a California corporation incorporated in March and is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System the FRB as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of as amended the BHCA. The stock of United Security Bancshares is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol UBFO. Concurrent with the issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities USB Capital Trust II used the proceeds of the Trust Preferred Securities offering to purchase a like amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. Time deposits represent . At December the Bank had total loans net of unearned fees outstanding of . million representing approximately . of total deposits and . Repayment of agricultural loans is generally from the expected cash flow of the borrower. of the total loan portfolio at December and respectively. Described below are elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the Company andor the Bank. As a result of the DoddFrank Act nonbank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that are at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company. In particular a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a lowquality asset as defined in the Federal Reserve Act. Limitations on Business and Investment Activities Under the BHCA a bank holding company must obtain the FRBs approval before i directly or indirectly acquiring more than ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company ii acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank iii or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. The Company and the Bank met the criteria and adopted the community bank leverage ratio framework in the third quarter of . Pursuant to FDICIA the FRB promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed based on the level of its capital ratios Under the regulations a bank shall be deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total riskbased capital ratio of or more has a Tier riskbased capital ratio of or more has a common equity Tier capital ratio of . Banks classified as undercapitalized are required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company if any. In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions commercial banking organizations such as the Bank may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal or state banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law rule regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. The FDIC utilizes a riskbased assessment system to set quarterly insurance premium assessments which categorizes banks into four risk categories based on capital levels and supervisory CAMELS ratings and names them Risk Categories I II III and IV. Among other benefits each Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The PATRIOT Act as implemented by various federal regulatory agencies requires the Company and the Bank to establish and implement policies and procedures with respect to among other matters antimoney laundering compliance suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers and prospective customers. Many of the provisions of the AML Act deal with the operations of the federal agencies primarily responsible for addressing terrorism financing and the safeguarding of the national security of the United States such as the U.S. Treasury and its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network FinCEN including the requirement for FinCEN to engage antimoney laundering AML and terrorist financing investigations experts and the requirement to facilitate information sharing with other federal and state and even foreign law enforcement agencies. Other sections increase civil penalties for financial institutions and persons violating the recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Customer Information Privacy and Cybersecurity The FRB and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential personal and nonpublic customer information.

storage systems and offer services related to our products. We plan to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full SelfDriving FSD battery cell and other technologies. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable efficient reliable and costeffective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall. Energy Generation and Storage Our expertise in electrical mechanical civil and software engineering allows us to design engineer manufacture and install energy generating and storage products and components including at the residential through utility scale. However sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to volatility from time to time. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns. Financial Services Automotive Purchase Financing and Leases We offer leasing andor loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America Europe and Asia ourselves and through various financial institutions. Our solar PPAs offered primarily to commercial customers charge a fee per kilowatthour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy electric vehicles battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase including through providing tax credits to consumers. Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zeroemission vehicles ZEVs greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phaseout starting in or later.
