We plan to continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full SelfDriving FSD battery cell and other technologies. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable efficient reliable and costeffective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. By taking a modular approach to the design of battery systems we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall. Energy Generation and Storage Our expertise in electrical mechanical civil and software engineering allows us to design engineer manufacture and install energy generating and storage products and components including at the residential through utility scale. However sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets which may expose us to volatility from time to time. We also remarket used Tesla vehicles acquired from other sources including lease returns. Financial Services Automotive Purchase Financing and Leases We offer leasing andor loan financing arrangements for our vehicles in certain jurisdictions in North America Europe and Asia ourselves and through various financial institutions. Our solar PPAs offered primarily to commercial customers charge a fee per kilowatthour based on the amount of electricity produced by our solar energy systems. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy electric vehicles battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase including through providing tax credits to consumers. Automotive Regulatory Credits We earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zeroemission vehicles ZEVs greenhouse gas fuel economy and clean fuel. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. These tax credits are primarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phaseout starting in or later. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturers suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing. SelfDriving Vehicles Generally laws pertaining to selfdriving vehicles are evolving globally and in some cases may create restrictions on features that we develop. Solar EnergyGeneral We are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. Sales of electricity and nonsale equipment leases by third parties such as our leases and PPAs have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions. We believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering selfdriving technologies charging solutions and other features and services and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued progress on our Autopilot FSD and neural network capabilities Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and services similar to ours. We are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of management systems that ensure social environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations as well as to demonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. Our incidents per vehicle continue to drop even as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling impactful jobs with best inindustry benefits. These include harassment retaliation violence intimidation and discrimination of any kind on the basis of race color religion national origin gender sexual orientation gender identity gender expression age disability or veteran status. Responding to questions timely is key so we implemented HR Answer Bars in the factories where employees can easily access and speak with an HR representative immediately regarding career advice benefits or any concerns the employee may have.']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## [4] Building and Training Model"],"metadata":{"id":"dWrmwWTW-PGg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### [4.1] Create Model Function"],"metadata":{"id":"1UUBYu-K2ZFt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create function for RoBERTa fine-tuning - multiclass classification\n","def create_rbert_multiclass_model(checkpoint,\n","                                 num_classes = 10,\n","                                 hidden_size = 256,\n","                                 dropout=0.2,\n","                                 learning_rate=0.00001):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Build a simple classification model with BERT.

At September we held franchises having terms generally ranging from five to years. A significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms. Rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a traditional and common form of cost adjustment mechanism. Additionally some jurisdictions have performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in gas costs. Under the performancebased ratemaking adjustments purchased gas costs savings are shared between the Company and its customers. Our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers and marketers. Our customers demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities. Ratemaking Activity Overview The method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate. Generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital.
