Main lesson objective: Explain the Berlin Wall from an East German perspective with an emphasis on the most significant individuals and their role in how the wall was constructed.

From an East German perspective, the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961 as a "protective barrier" against Western influence and to prevent the mass exodus of skilled workers to West Germany. Key figures involved in its planning and implementation included:

1. Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party: He was the primary architect of the wall's construction, convincing Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev of its necessity.

2. Erich Honecker, Central Committee Secretary for Security Matters: He oversaw the operational planning and execution of the wall's construction, coordinating with military and security forces.

3. Willi Stoph, Minister of Defense: He mobilized East German troops and border guards to assist in the wall's construction and subsequent fortification.

4. Erich Mielke, Minister for State Security (Stasi): He directed intelligence operations to identify potential escapees and monitor public reaction to the wall.

5. Heinz Hoffmann, Chief of the National People's Army: He coordinated military support for the wall's construction and ongoing defense.

The East German leadership portrayed the wall as a necessary measure to protect their socialist state from Western "fascists" and "spies." They claimed it would safeguard the country's economy and prevent brain drain. The official name given to the wall was the "Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart," emphasizing its purported defensive purpose.

The construction process began on August 13, 1961, initially using barbed wire and makeshift barriers. Over time, it evolved into a complex system of concrete walls, guard towers, and heavily fortified border zones. The wall effectively divided Berlin for 28 years, becoming a symbol of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain separating East and West.
