Main lesson objective: Provide a summary of the most significant people involved in the women's suffrage movement of the 1920s.

The key figures and their contributions to the women's suffrage movement in the United States leading up to the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920 include:

1. Susan B. Anthony: Co-founded the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869. She was a tireless activist who traveled the country giving speeches, organizing protests, and lobbying for women's rights. Anthony was arrested for voting illegally in 1872, which brought national attention to the cause.

2. Elizabeth Cady Stanton: Co-organized the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, which is considered the birth of the women's rights movement in the US. She authored the Declaration of Sentiments, modeled after the Declaration of Independence, which outlined women's grievances and demands for equality.

3. Alice Paul: Founded the National Woman's Party in 1916 and organized the first pickets of the White House. She introduced more militant tactics to the movement, including hunger strikes when jailed for protesting.

4. Carrie Chapman Catt: Served as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and developed the "Winning Plan," a state-by-state strategy to win suffrage.

5. Lucy Stone: Founded the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) in 1869, which focused on state-level campaigns for suffrage. She was also the first woman to keep her maiden name after marriage.

6. Ida B. Wells-Barnett: African American journalist and activist who fought for both women's suffrage and civil rights. She challenged the racism within the suffrage movement and founded the Alpha Suffrage Club, the first Black women's suffrage organization in Illinois.

7. Sojourner Truth: Former slave who became a powerful speaker for both abolition and women's rights. Her famous "Ain't I a Woman?" speech highlighted the intersectionality of race and gender in the fight for equality.

8. Lucretia Mott: Quaker minister and abolitionist who helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention and was a key figure in merging the abolitionist and women's rights movements.

These women and many others contributed to the suffrage movement through various means, including organizing conventions, giving speeches, writing articles and pamphlets, lobbying legislators, and engaging in civil disobedience. Their collective efforts over decades culminated in the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920, granting women the right to vote nationwide.
