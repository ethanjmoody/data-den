Main lesson objective: Outline the key differences between the ancient Greek philosophies of Socrates and Plato.

Socrates and Plato are foundational figures in Western philosophy, and while their ideas are interconnected, they exhibit distinct approaches to knowledge, ethics, and the nature of reality.

**Knowledge:**
Socrates is known for his dialectical method, often referred to as the Socratic Method, which involves asking probing questions to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas. He believed that knowledge is inherently linked to virtue and that true knowledge comes from understanding oneself. Socrates famously claimed, "I know that I know nothing," emphasizing the importance of recognizing one's own ignorance as a starting point for gaining knowledge.

In contrast, Plato, a student of Socrates, developed a more systematic approach to knowledge. He introduced the Theory of Forms, positing that the material world is a shadow of a higher, unchanging reality composed of ideal Forms or Ideas. For Plato, knowledge is not just about empirical observation but involves understanding these eternal Forms. For example, the Form of Beauty itself exists beyond any beautiful object in the physical world.

**Ethics:**
Socrates believed that ethical behavior is rooted in knowledge; if a person knows what is good, they will act accordingly. He argued that moral virtue is a form of knowledge and that wrongdoing is a result of ignorance. This is encapsulated in his assertion that "no one does wrong willingly," suggesting that people commit immoral acts because they lack true understanding.

Plato expanded on Socratic ethics by proposing a more structured view of justice and virtue in his work "The Republic." He argued for the idea of the "philosopher-king," suggesting that those who understand the Forms, especially the Form of the Good, are best suited to rule. Plato's ethical framework is more prescriptive, outlining a vision of a just society where individuals fulfill their roles based on their abilities and knowledge.

**Nature of Reality:**
Socrates focused on the importance of the examined life, emphasizing that understanding oneself and one's place in the world is crucial. He did not leave behind written works, and much of what we know about him comes from Plato's dialogues, which depict Socratic discussions about morality and existence.

Plato's view of reality is more metaphysical. He distinguished between the world of appearances (the physical world) and the world of Forms (the true reality). In his allegory of the cave, found in "The Republic," he illustrates how most people live in ignorance, perceiving only shadows of the true Forms. The journey out of the cave symbolizes the philosopher's ascent to knowledge and understanding of
