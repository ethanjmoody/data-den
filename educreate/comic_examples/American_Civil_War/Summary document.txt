Main lesson objective: Describe the factors that led to the U.S. Civil War.

The American Civil War of 1861-1865 was the result of a complex interplay of economic, political, and social factors that had been building tension between the North and South for decades. Here's an analysis of the primary factors that contributed to the outbreak of the war:

Economic Factors:
1. Divergent economies: The North had an industrialized, manufacturing-based economy, while the South relied heavily on agriculture, particularly cotton production.

2. Slavery as an economic institution: The South's economy was deeply dependent on slave labor for its cotton plantations, while the North had largely abolished slavery.

3. Tariffs: Protective tariffs favored Northern manufacturing but hurt the South's agricultural exports, leading to conflicts like the Nullification Crisis of 1832.

Political Factors:
1. States' rights vs. federal power: The South emphasized states' rights, while the North advocated for a stronger federal government.

2. Expansion and new territories: The question of whether new states would be slave or free states caused significant political tension (e.g., Missouri Compromise of 1820, Compromise of 1850).

3. Election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860: Lincoln's victory, despite not being on the ballot in most Southern states, was seen as a threat to Southern interests.

Social Factors:
1. Abolitionist movement: The growing strength of the abolitionist movement in the North increased tensions with the South.

2. Cultural differences: The North and South developed distinct cultural identities, exacerbating the divide between the regions.

3. Population growth and representation: The North's population was growing faster than the South's, leading to concerns about political representation in Congress.

Key Events and Policies that Heightened Tensions:
1. Missouri Compromise (1820): Set the 36Â°30' parallel as the dividing line between slave and free territories.

2. Nullification Crisis (1832-1833): South Carolina's attempt to nullify federal tariffs highlighted the conflict between state and federal power.

3. Mexican-American War (1846-1848): Raised questions about the expansion of slavery into newly acquired territories.

4. Compromise of 1850: Attempted to balance slave and free states, but included the controversial Fugitive Slave Act.

5. Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854): Repealed the Missouri Compromise and led to violent conflicts in Kansas ("Bleeding Kansas").

6. Dred Scott decision (1857): Supreme Court ruling that denied citizenship to African Americans and prohibited Congress from banning slavery in the territories.

7. John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry (1859): Increased Southern fears of slave revolts and Northern abolitionist aggression.

8. Election of Abraham Lincoln (1860): Triggered the secession of Southern states, as they feared Lincoln's anti-slavery stance.

These factors and events collectively contributed to the growing divide between North and South, ultimately leading to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. The complex interplay of economic interests, political ideologies, and social tensions created an environment where compromise became increasingly difficult, and conflict became seemingly inevitable.
