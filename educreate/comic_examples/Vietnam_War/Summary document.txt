Main lesson objective: I want my class to learn about some of the different perspectives toward the Vietnam War.

The Vietnam War generated intense debate and opposing viewpoints within the United States during the 1960s and early 1970s. These perspectives evolved significantly as the conflict progressed:

1. Pro-War/Hawk Perspective:
Initially, many Americans supported U.S. involvement based on:
- Containment of communism (Domino Theory)
- Supporting South Vietnam's sovereignty
- Honoring commitments to allies

This view was prevalent among:
- The Johnson and Nixon administrations
- Many older Americans and conservatives
- Some veterans' groups

2. Anti-War/Dove Perspective:
Opposition grew steadily, especially among:
- College students and young adults
- Liberal intellectuals and clergy
- Civil rights activists

Key arguments included:
- Questioning the war's morality and necessity
- Concerns about the draft and high casualty rates
- Criticism of the war's economic costs

Evolution of Perspectives:

1965-1967: 
- Initial public support for the war
- Growing skepticism as casualty numbers increased

1968:
- Tet Offensive shocked many Americans
- Anti-war movement gained momentum
- Increased media coverage of atrocities

1969-1973:
- Nixon's "Vietnamization" policy divided opinions
- Kent State shootings (1970) intensified anti-war sentiment
- Pentagon Papers (1971) further eroded public trust

By the early 1970s:
- Majority of Americans favored withdrawal
- "Silent Majority" still supported the war effort
- Generational divide became more pronounced

The debate also highlighted broader social issues:
- Government credibility
- Role of media in wartime
- Generational and cultural divisions

As the war progressed, the anti-war movement gained strength, while support for the conflict declined. This shift in public opinion ultimately contributed to the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam in 1973.
