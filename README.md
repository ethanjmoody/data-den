## Enter the `data-den`

Welcome to my data science portfolio! :wave:

This repository showcases a diverse range of projects spanning different domains and personal areas of interest. Some of these projects were individual undertakings; others were the result of group efforts. Here, you'll find examples of:

- :robot: **Machine Learning & Modeling**: Projects demonstrating predictive modeling and algorithm development.
- :test_tube: **Causal Inference**: Insights drawn from designing and interpreting experiments to infer causality.
- :bar_chart: **Applied Statistics**: Applications of statistical methods to explore data and drive decisions.
- :speech_balloon: **NLP and GenAI**: Explorations of language models, info retrieval, and response generation.
- :writing_hand: **Scientific & Technical Writing**: Papers written to explain project findings and their practical significance.

Each project includes comprehensive code, notes on key findings, and visualizations to demonstrate my approach and results. Feel free to explore and reach out with any questions or collaboration opportunities.

## Featured Projects

Project materials reside in `individual folders`, labeled by project name. Below are brief descriptions of each featured project, along with the skills and tools used to develop them:

:mag: **From RAGs to Riches: How Search and Q&A Capabilities with RAG can Accelerate E&M Workflows**
- Implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to generate answers to NLP/GenAI questions.
- Evaluated the impacts of embedding models, LLMs, document chunking, and prompting on RAG performance.
- Analyzed generated answers against ground-truths, scoring >0.90 on faithfulness and answer relevancy metrics.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Python, LangChain, Qdrant vector stores, Hugging Face and pre-trained LLMs, prompt engineering, RAGAS and other RAG evaluation metrics (e.g., BERTScore), R Markdown (paper writing).

:open_book: **Beyond Words: Exploring the Effects of Font Size & Pacing on Reading Enjoyment and Fact Recall**
- Designed and conducted a within-subjects 2x2x4 factorial experiment with significant treatment effects.
- Completed a literature review, developed a testable hypothesis, and ran a power analysis to inform sample size.
- Built linear regressions of increasing complexity, and summarized findings/limitations in a scientific paper.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Qualtrics (survey and data collection), R (analysis/modeling), linear regressions, power analysis with randomization inference, Extreme Value Bounds (EVB) and attrition analysis, R Markdown (paper writing).

:classical_building: **Unveiling Complex Interconnections Among Companies through Learned Embeddings**
- Explored alternative methods of stock sector classification using learned embeddings and graph clustering.
- Summarized Form 10-K text data and trained six classification models to explore company relationships.
- Constructed a portfolio that outperformed market volatility by ~17% and volatility-adjusted return in 1.5yr window.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Fine-tuning pre-trained NLP transformer models (e.g., BERT and sentence transformers), TensorFlow neural networks/deep learning, clustering, Overleaf and LaTeX (ACL-style paper writing).

:credit_card: **Predicting Credit Card Customer Attrition using the "Churn-Discern" Model**
- Developed a machine learning model to classify retained vs. lost credit card customers based on ten features.
- Compared a variety of modeling approaches: GLMs, SVMs, naïve Bayes, KNN, random forest, GBMs, and neural nets.
- Used insights from EDA and hyperparameter tuning to achieve 96% accuracy and 92% recall on hold-out (test) data.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Python, Scikit-learn/TensorFlow (data preprocessing and modeling), SHAP/Shapley (model interpretation and feature importance), class imbalance handling (e.g., SMOTE/class reweighting).

:moneybag: **Estimating Key Drivers of Peer-to-Peer Loan Interest Rates**
- Fitted three linear models to predict interest rates for a specific segment of consumer microloans.
- Identified statistical and practical significance for several predictors, and summarized results in a paper.
- Presented important considerations around model interpretability, bias, and business/customer trade-offs.
- Highlighted skills and tools: R (analysis/modeling), statistical goodness of fit testing, linear regressions, R Markdown (paper writing).

:page_with_curl: **Unmasking the Limitations of a Recent COVID-19 Study and Evaluating Causal Claims**
- Crafted a response to a study on COVID-19 school masking policy, evaluating the assumptions behind the study's claims.
- Summarized the study's design and major conclusions, and offered an argument against causality based on the chosen design.
- Posited characteristics of an "ideal", alternative experiment, where the study's causal claims could be better supported.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Logic and reasoning, critical thinking, understanding of experimental design, R Markdown (paper writing).

## Side Quests

Additional examples of code, exploratory work, and general miscellany – not of the same caliber as project work – are stored in a separate `playground` folder. This is by no means off-limits, so explore away if you'd like.
