## Enter the `data-den`

Welcome to my data science portfolio! :wave:

This repository showcases a diverse range of projects spanning different domains and personal areas of interest. Some of these projects were individual undertakings; others were the result of group efforts (with co-authors noted). Here, you'll find examples of:

- :robot: **Machine Learning & Modeling**: Projects demonstrating predictive modeling and algorithm development.
- :test_tube: **Causal Inference**: Insights drawn from designing and interpreting experiments to infer causality.
- :bar_chart: **Applied Statistics**: Applications of statistical methods to explore data and drive decisions.
- :speech_balloon: **NLP and GenAI**: Explorations of language models, information retrieval, and response generation.
- :writing_hand: **Scientific & Technical Writing**: Papers written to explain project findings and their practical significance.

Each project includes comprehensive code, notes on key findings, and visualizations to demonstrate my approach and results. Feel free to explore and reach out with any questions or collaboration opportunities.

## Main Quests: Featured Projects

- Completed a literature review, outlined a hypothesis, and conducted a power analysis to inform sample size.
- Built linear regressions of increasing complexity, and summarized findings/limitations in a scientific paper.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Qualtrics (survey and data collection), R (analysis/modeling), linear regressions, power analysis with randomization inference, Extreme Value Bounds (EVB) and attrition analysis, R Markdown (paper writing).

:page_with_curl: **Unmasking the Limitations of a Recent COVID-19 Study and Evaluating Causal Claims**
- Responded to a study on COVID-19 school masking, evaluating the assumptions behind the study's claims.
- Summarized study's conclusions and offered an argument against causality based on the chosen design.
- Posited characteristics of an "ideal", alternative experiment that could better support the study's claims.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Logic and reasoning, critical thinking, understanding of experimental design, R Markdown (paper writing).

:classical_building: **Unveiling Complex Interconnections Among Companies through Learned Embeddings**
- Explored alternative methods of stock sector classification using learned embeddings and graph clustering.
- Summarized Form 10-K text data and trained six classification models to explore company relationships.
- Constructed a portfolio that outperformed market volatility by ~17% and volatility-adjusted return over 1.5yrs.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Fine-tuning pre-trained NLP transformer models (BERT, sentence transformers), TensorFlow neural nets/deep learning, clustering, Overleaf and LaTeX (ACL-style paper writing).

:credit_card: **Predicting Credit Card Customer Attrition using the "Churn-Discern" Model**
- Developed a machine learning model to classify retained vs. lost credit card customers based on ten features.
- Tested a range of modeling approaches: GLMs, SVMs, naïve Bayes, KNN, random forest, GBMs, neural nets.
- Applied insights from EDA and HP tuning to achieve 96% accuracy and 92% recall on hold-out (test) set.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Python, Scikit-learn/TensorFlow (data preprocessing and modeling), Shapley (model interpretation and feature importance), class imbalance handling (SMOTE/class reweighting).

:takeout_box: **Advising a Gourmet Meals Startup Business**
- Created SQL queries to provide insights to customer-, sales-, and meal-related business questions.
- Used Neo4j and graph algorithms to develop recommendations for business strategy and expansion.
- Provided an overview of NoSQL database/tool options (e.g., MongoDB, Redis) for the business to consider.
- Highlighted skills and tools: Python, SQL (Postgres), Neo4j, nested JSON parsing, business analysis, recommendation development.

:moneybag: **Estimating Key Drivers of Peer-to-Peer Loan Interest Rates**
- Fitted three linear models to predict interest rates for a specific segment of consumer microloans.
- Identified statistical and practical significance for several predictors, and summarized results in a paper.
- Presented important considerations around model interpretability, bias, and business/customer trade-offs.
- Highlighted skills and tools: R (analysis/modeling), statistical goodness of fit testing, linear regressions, R Markdown (paper writing).

:us: **Measuring Voting Difficulty in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election**
- Analyzed voting challenges experienced by Democratic (D) and Republican (R) voters based on ANES data. 
- Rejected the hypothesis that (D) and (R) voters experienced the same level of difficulty when voting.
- Explored necessary assumptions for t-tests and both the statistical and practical significance of findings.
- Highlighted skills and tools: R (analysis/modeling), hypothesis testing (t-test), data cleaning, R Markdown (paper writing).

## Side Quests: Quick Analyses

Additional examples of code, exploratory work, and quick analyses – not of the same caliber as project work – are stored in a separate `playground` folder. This folder is by no means off-limits, so explore away if you'd like.
